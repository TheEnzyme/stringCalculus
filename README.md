stringCalculus
==============

String based Calculus module (only contains differentiation, not fully implemented yet)

TODO:

      Chain Rule
      Irrational powers and coefficients
      Negative powers
      Integration
      Cleanup string outputs, ie format coefficients and powers of 0 and powers of 1
      
 And probably lots more stuff that I haven't noticed/forgot seeing as the first iteration of this readme vanished into the aether.
